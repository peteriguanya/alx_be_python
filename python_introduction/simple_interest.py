# Step 1: Define the variables
principal = 1000   # Initial investment
rate = 0.05        # Annual interest rate as a decimal
time = 3           # Time in years

# Step 2: Calculate simple interest
interest = principal * rate * time

# Step 3: Print the result
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")
